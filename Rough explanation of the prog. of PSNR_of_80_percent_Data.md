Rough explanation of the prog. of PSNR_of_80_percent_Data :

1. chooses 80% of data as training data and 20% data as Test Data randomly using python
2. Makes Directory for above datasets separately in respective folders and moves the data using python
3. runs psnr algo on each of the data from different data sets(arial,sequence and others) w.r.t their noise density [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
4. saves psnr values on a .csv file
